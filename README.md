Web Slicer
============

This is the source for an abandoned project of making a web based slicer for 3D printings.

## What is left to do?

Pretty much everything. There is nothing here that actually works at this point, it is mostly a visual mockup.

## Rookie coding advisory:

This was one of my very first webapp and THREE.js experiments. The code could use a lot of clean up.
It also uses JQuery, which I have banished from more recent efforts as an insult to good coding taste.
